# Cleaning_Data_Project

This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and tidying the dataset collected from smartphone.

## Repository Contents

run_analysis.R: The main script that processes the dataset and generates a tidy dataset.

CodeBook.md: file explaining the dataset, variables, and transformations.

tidy_dataset.txt: The final clean dataset output.

## How to Run the Script

Place run_analysis.R in the working directory.

Open R and set the working directory where run_analysis.R is located.

Run the script using:

source("run_analysis.R")

It will generate tidy_dataset.txt as the final output.

## Output Dataset

The tidy_dataset.txt contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The data comes from: Reyes-Ortiz, J., Anguita, D., Ghio, A., Oneto, L., & Parra, X. (2013). Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository. <https://doi.org/10.24432/C54S4K>.
